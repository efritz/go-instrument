An instrumenting code generator.

## Installation

Simply run `go get -u github.com/efritz/go-instrument/...`.

## Binary Usage

As an example, we generate an instrumented version of the `Client` interface from the
Redis library [deepjoy](https://github.com/efritz/deepjoy). If the deepjoy library can
be found in the GOPATH, then the following command will generate a file called
`client_instrumented.go` with the following content. This assumes that the current
working directory (Also in the GOPATH) is called *playground*.

```bash
go-instrument github.com/efritz/deepjoy -i Client --metric-prefix Do:redis
```

```go
// Code generated by github.com/efritz/go-instrument; DO NOT EDIT.
// This file was generated by robots at
// 2018-10-16T09:12:34-05:00
// using the command
// $ go-instrument github.com/efritz/deepjoy -i Client --metric-prefix Do:redis

package playground

import (
	deepjoy "github.com/efritz/deepjoy"
	red "github.com/efritz/imperial/red"
	"time"
)

type InstrumentedClient struct {
	deepjoy.Client
	reporter *red.Reporter
}

func NewInstrumentedClient(inner deepjoy.Client, reporter *red.Reporter) *InstrumentedClient {
	return &InstrumentedClient{Client: inner, reporter: reporter}
}

func (i *InstrumentedClient) Do(v0 string, v1 ...interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
	start := time.Now()
	i.reporter.ReportAttempt("redis")
	r0, r1 := i.Client.Do(v0, v1...)
	duration := float64(time.Now().Sub(start)) / float64(time.Second)
	i.reporter.ReportError("redis", r1)
	i.reporter.ReportDuration("redis", duration)
	return r0, r1
}
```

The suggested way to generate instrumented version of an interface for a project is to
use go-generate. Then, when the interface is updated, running `go generate` on the
package will re-generate the instrumented versions.

```go
package foo

//go:generate go-instrument -f github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/dynamodb/dynamodbiface --metric-prefix '.*:dynamodb'
```

### Flags

The following flags are defined by the binary.

| Name          | Short Flag | Description  |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| package       | p          | The name of the generated package. Is the name of target directory if dirname or filename is supplied by default. |
| prefix        |            | A prefix used in the name of each instrumented struct. Should be TitleCase by convention. |
| interfaces    | i          | A whitelist of interfaces to generate given the import paths. |
| filename      | o          | The target output file. All instrumented structs are writen to this file. |
| dirname       | d          | The target output directory. Each instrumented will be written to a unique file. |
| force         | f          | Do not abort if a write to disk would overwrite an existing file. |
| list          |            | Dry run - print the interfaces found in the given import paths. |
| metric-prefix |            | A "<regex>:<prefix>" pair. An instrumented method matching the regex emits metrics using the prefix. |

If neither dirname nor filename are supplied, then the generated code is printed to standard out.

If no metric prefixes are supplied, then the instrumented version generated is
effectively a no-operation decorator around a concrete implemetnation.

## Instrumented Struct Usage

An instrumented version of an interface is initialized via a constructor that
takes a concrete instance of the underlying interface as well as an instance of
a [RED Metric Reporter](https://github.com/efritz/imperial/tree/master/red).

It is required that this reporter be initialized to configurations for each of
metric prefixes that were supplied at generation time. For example, a valid RED
reporter for the example above is given below.

```go
import "github.com/efritz/imperial/red"

func makeInstrumentedClient(client deepjoy.Client, reporter imperial.Reporter) {
    redisPrefixConfig := red.NewPrefixConfig(
        // Report operation durations in these buckets (in seconds)
        red.WithPrefixBuckets([]float64{0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1}),
    )

    // Create red reporter with `redis` prefix configuration
    redReporter := red.NewReporter(
        reporter,
        red.WithPrefixConfig("redis", redisPrefixConfig),
    )

    // Wrap the client
    return NewInstrumentedClient(client, redReporter)
}
```
